# House Price Prediction
 In this project, a house price estimation model was developed with XGBoost (Machine Learning Regression Algorithm) for users who are considering selling their house for 6 neighborhoods (Guzelyurt, Uncubozk√∂y, Laleli, Yeni Mahalle, Muradiye, Adnan Menderes) in Yunusemre district of Manisa. All data was pulled from a real estate site and processed with selenium. At the last stage, an interface is designed for the user with the flet library designed for Python.
